# Weather-Forecasting-Webapp
Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change at a given place. We look at weather data and the future predicted the weather to plan our days accordingly. Having visualizations helps us understand that data better. Developing this project using the Streamlit library we can create a responsive front-end which gives us more time to work on the actual back-end and the services we aim to provide. This project is a good start for beginners in python and it gives a basic understanding of how to use APIs and related python frameworks.
